# Codenation Website
This project was a dive into HTML and CSS, led by my instructors at CodeNation during my 4 week develop course.

## Intentions of this project
This project was meant to be a simple introduction to HTML and CSS, learning how to structure an HTML file, and link a stylesheet to it.
