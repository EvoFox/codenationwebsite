            <h2>Finding a team</h2>
            <p>So...</p> 
            <p >Today was an interesting one. I was doing the pre-expedition shopping, reserving stock in the market with some of the local merchants for it. Suddenly, I was approached by one of the touts. Kaelli, she’s a popular one. Knows everyone, and everyone likes her. Turns out she was running a message from the King of Cross-Trade, Shemeshka. While not entirely surprising, she’d picked up on our expedition and had done some of my job for me, sending me a few seemingly capable folks to give me a hand on this job. </p>
            
            <p>None of this was entirely surprising at this point, though it certainly got interested when a clueless popped into the backroom from ‘The Verdant Forest’. Anyhow, somehow from that encounter I managed to wind up with five folks signed up. Shemeshka only sent two of them, as far as I could tell. </p>
            
            <p>They’re... an interesting bunch, to say the least. Less limbs between them than I would have liked though. Despite that, it might have been weeks to find a group that was suitable for this job, so I’ll take it.</p>
            
            <p>Time to document the crew so far: </p>
        
            <p class = "indent">Sun At Dusk, A tabaxi. An interesting character, mostly just because of the fact she’s well-armed. Guns are a rarity to see, and she’s packing multiple. As far as I can tell she’s Shemeshka’s plant for this. No idea what she wants, but she’s definitely handy if when we get into a fight. I just hope that prosthetic arm will hold up. </p>

            <p class="indent">Harlan, A human. Seems to be a bard, with the way he was idly playing that guitar. I’ve not looked into him too much so far, but he seems pleasant enough. Seems to be more of a fighter than most bards I’ve seen too, hopefully I’m right with that. </p>

            <p class="indent">Lillyanna Rook, another tabaxi. I... How to describe this... she has no limbs... No natural ones at least. She seems perfectly agile though, I’m wondering if she made these ones herself or if they were made by her mentor, and the previous owner of the shop. She seems a bit sarcastic, were I not in the middle of recruiting for a job, I would have responded to her ‘is it contagious?’ line with the same thing after I learned of her mentor dying to the plague. She could be useful though, if not herself then she should be able to fix up Dusk and that large cat-construct of hers. </p>

            <p class="indent">I’m not going to remember his name, some kind of construct. Oh, so this is an interesting one... A large stone golem looking thing popped up. It’s not actually interested in the expedition, only in the guns that Dusk has. Either way, I’ll be happy if it gets between me and the things that are trying to kill us. It has surprising grace, considering it’s made of stone. Incredibly delicate handwriting too, now that I think about it. </p>

            <p class="indent">Aurora, a ‘human’. This is the Clueless. In fact, this is THE Clueless. I've never seen anyone so... completely and utterly confused. Apparently sent by some ‘Lord Oberon’ to “Find the white stag.” Which in itself is odd enough, but she doesn’t even know what a stag is, or why it would be white. Anyway, there’s something else interested about this one, looks like a regular human, yet is apparently over a hundred years old... Near as I can tell she looks around her late twenties if I had to guess.  </p>

            <p>Anyway, that’s my new crew I suppose. I hope they’re going to make good allies... or at least decent meat/stone shields.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Something struck me about Dusk and Harlan, they more or less just skimmed the contract. It was like they hadn’t a care in the world about it. They’re either idiots or have another motive. Lillyanna was smart about it though, took it to her lawyer and got it appraised by him. I know that the pay is shite and the clause about me being able to take ownership of anything of importance to myself or the fraternity will come up there, but all in all it’s a fair contract. Assuming that there’s actually anything to salvage where we’re going.  </p>

            <p>Aurora signed it with a picture of a leaf... </p>

            <p>The Golem signed it once it was sure that the gunslinger was coming, didn’t even read the contract. Something about learning about the combat efficacy of firearms or something. Again, this one will make a good ‘get in the way’ tool. </p>

            <p>So that’s the merry band of folks and things that are coming with me into Under-Sigil. </p>

            <p>The next part that should be noted is that The King of Cross-Trade decided to bestow 2000 copper commons onto us to pay for the gear and supplies. I’m slightly concerned about her motives, but I don’t believe I’ve ever crossed her, so I don’t think I need to be overly worried about it right now. </p>

            <p>Kaelli gave us some advice about getting over to Under-Sigil safely. We could go through The Hive if we wanted to be there fast but... No. That was almost never an option, not without seeing how these new hires perform in a ‘stress-test’. I’d rather take longer to get there and do it relatively safely, than walk into the hive and get mugged seventeen times in as many minutes. </p>

            <p>When I dropped some coins in her hand Aurora decided to drop a shiny stone into it. I suppose that was a form of currency where she came from. </p>

            <p>Oh, I almost forgot; Aurora wants to speak to Robert White-Stag, one of the co-signers to this contract. I suppose she saw the name and decided that she needed to talk to him because of his name? Seems to think her deity can do no wrong or something. I wonder what deity it actually is, the bard mentioned something about being the King of Beasts or something? I’ll need to look into him at some point. </p>

            <h2>A Find!</h2>
            <p>So...</p>
            <p>The past few hours have been interesting, first finding out that my new employees are going to be paid far better than previously thought. That's a good thing; their spirits will be much higher knowing that their time is going to be worth so much now. Regardless, I'm taking a lower cut on this one, I don't need the gold as much as some of them seem to.</p>

            <p>Then there's the matter of the potential political incident. A Githyanki captain, slain by a silver artifact sword he was to be delivering to someone. An honour to be sure, but if my people find out that it has been stolen, they're going to launch an assault to get it back, or murder as many people as they can. On the wall behind him was a rune, painted in blood. Abyssal, if I'm not mistaken. Unfortunatly, I'm not well versed in the language, I've taken a bried sketch of it for the moment, though seperated, in case the rune itself holds some power</p>

            <p>If I happen to come across the artifact, I'll certainly be trying to get a hold on it and finishing the delivery to prevent the... repurcussions. I'd rather not be drafted to raid the place I've been calling home for so long.</p>

            <p>Lillyanna decided to antagonise some of the local beggars, and not even particularly well, she drove one into a rage before Sun at Dusk decided to finish it and shoot his weapon out of his hand. It was an amazing shot. The speed and precision that she wields that weapon with is something to behold.</p>

            <p>That ended the confrontation quickly, though Lillyanna managed to get attacked by one of their pet rats, hopefully she doesn’t end up with some plague or another.</p>
            
            <p>After that we were off to the Dead Nations to make the delivery requested by Shemeshka. The package turned out to be an attempted assassination it seems. A devil in a box, being delivered right to a ghoul. It might have worked, had it not been for the cities customs agent doing his job right. It didn't take too much to be taken down, but that's the benefit of outnumbering it as much as we did. It seemed to be absorbing most of what hit it, but it made quite the mess once I managed to hit it.</p>

            <p>It seems the Cross-Trade Twins are being politicked now, being sent to deliver something to someone else. The sender has assured them it's not a bomb, but who knows if they could really be trusted after all that.</p>

            <p>They did however provide me with some information of interest, regarding the large sinkhole just outside of their city, in relation to the Twelve Standing Stones. With the legend being that there were 12 wizards that wanted to takes Sigil, and how it actually turned out that they were lost Stone Elementals, and something woke them up one day and they burrowed deep underground, and haven’t been heard from since. It’s reasonable to assume that they managed to find somewhere comfortable to sleep. We were also told of a shortcut to our destination, it was nice and quick, if not a little precarious.  </p>

            <p>When we found the cranium rat tunnels things started to get a tad disappointing. The team I hired all seem to be a tad bit weak-minded, falling victim to the rat's psychic whisperings. One of them seems more vulnerable than most, our dear Lillyanna fell victim to a psychic rat trap... In psychic rat tunnels. I think she wanted to repurpose the trap but... I don’t know why. It was an ingenious trap from the rats, to be sure though. </p>

            <p>Despite that we did find some interesting things inside of the tunnels, a flooded section that we are yet to explore, I will be broaching the topic of exploring that area with my team soon, it is possible that we could find something of note. </p>

            <p>The path we chose to explore was something of a jackpot. Illithid clothes that had been shed, seemingly recently, and a pillar with a Illithid prayer written on it in Qualith. It seems to be radiating... contentment? As close as an Illithid can feel, probably. </p>

            <p>Onwards from that we found a book that I will need to study further, that from the scene that I saw, seems to imply that there was a mindflayer trying to transcribe it into Qualith, though I can’t see why it would have been doing that as of this moment.  </p>

            <p>The last thing we found was an illithid corpse, slung up as a warning seemingly trying to scare people away from the Rats Nest. </p>

            <p>We had a brief skirmish with the Cranium Rat swarm, our Bard managed to take out quite a number of them very quickly with a shockwave. It was an impressive showing to be sure, but unfortunately, he ended up getting swarmed by them and their whispers kept him locked down, along with our resident golem. </p>

            <p>The combat went rather well, no deaths, though due to rushing in and getting stunned, Harlan was knocked unconscious. Our militant tabaxi happens to be skilled with a medical kit though, providing him with some frontline medical aid. She continues to impress, proving to be my favourite of the team by far. </p>

            <p>We’re taking a short break... Well, the rest of them are, I’m documenting and excavating as needed before we backtrack to the flooded area. </p>
            <p>Vymis,</p>

        <div class="page">
            <h2>Back to Sigil!</h2>
            <p>So...</p>

            <p>Harlan and Lillyanna slipped off back to Sigil a touch earlier than the rest of us, Lillyanna seemed to be coming down with something. It was likely something to do with the rat bite she took earlier, and Harlan was going to get himself checked for the same thing, since he took a good number of bites in the fight against the Us. </p>

            <p>While unfortunate to be two down, our expedition was mostly over anyhow, we had the flooded section to cover, but we had already found the Rat Nest and dealt with them. It was unlikely that we were going to run into anything too dangerous.  </p>

            <p>Onto the matter of the flooded section, we didn’t find too much of note down here. There seems to have been a source of infinite water in one of the fountains, which would explain the flooding. If the drain got clogged then an infinite water source would flood it quickly, it’s quite the design flaw. The golem I brought along decided to take it and cork the decanter.  </p>

            <p>In another room in the area there was a marble elk statue, Aurora seemed to briefly think that it was the ‘White Stag’ that she was wanting to find for this ‘Lord Ebberon’ or whoever she said she was working for. After embracing the statue and whispering something at it, she stepped away and said it was the wrong one. A weird situation for sure. </p>

            <p>Finally, there was one more room, a stockpile of food. Grains, grains and more grains, oh, and some cheese. They were stamped with a few company logos, I popped into one when we got back into Sigil and let them know where their missing stock was. It seems that someone paid the shipping company to make a ‘mistake’ on the delivery and send it somewhere else instead. At the very least they now know that their supplier is not to be trusted, I might see about finding out what company they’ve been using and try to use that in the future, organise an ‘accidental’ delivery to myself... or perhaps another for framing purposes. Many currently unexplored opportunities for how this could be used, only time will tell. </p>

            <p>I also took an opportunity to mess with Aurora slightly, and sent her into a Githyanki racial bar as a bit of a joke. I wasn’t planning on letting her get hurt, I, among some others stayed around just in case something started to happen. It’s a good job too, because after she was sent off to another inn, two them seemed intent to mug her. At least until they saw three adventuring types following along behind them, they soon scarpered then. </p>

            <p>So, the inn that Aurora actually ended up renting a room in was the Red Lion, the Indep hangout. There’s a chance that she’s going to be indoctrinated, or at the very least protected from other factions. That could prove to be a good thing, or a bad thing, I can’t quite tell yet. </p>

            <p>After we’d seen to her getting somewhere safely, the rest of us decided to part ways, we’re meeting tomorrow in the early afternoon in order for me to supply their payments from the work. I might see about keeping them on if they’re interested, they could prove to be useful still. </p>

            <p>When I returned home, I took to filling out the paperwork needed to get all of their payments resolved as soon as possible. I handed it with one of the new hires at 9am sharp, to get it processed as soon as possible. I soon got called in to see Factol Hashkar, usually this would be quite the boring development. With the way the man talks you’d rather be filling out the longest forms available, in triplicate. However, this day was unlike most days, he was almost excited about something (Or at least what passes for excitement with him). </p>

            <p>He informed me that the Githyanki we found dead in Under-Sigil was actually one of our own clerks. Apparently, it wasn’t known that he held a Githyanki military rank, let alone actively serving. He let me know that the blood rune above his body was apparently chaos-speak. He’s asked me to keep an eye out for anything and to do some research into this. </p>

            <p>Anyhow, off to pay the employees. </p>

        <div class="page">
            <h2>Another Expedition!</h2>

            <p>So...</p>

            <p>I decided to pop back home for a while to study the book I recovered from the site. Upon a further inspection of the book, I’ve found notes that were written in qualith. The mindflayer we found dead appears to be a scholar of some kind, though it wrote in an unfamiliar dialect to me, it may be some kind of cypher perhaps? </p>

            <p>The first section of the book is entitled The Astromundi Chronicles. It seems to claim that mind flayers were once humanoids who rose up against their creators, managing to utterly annihilate them. The unity of rings here is very clearly taking effect, since that’s what we, the Gith, attempted to do to gain our freedom. It also states that the Astromundi is a cluster of worlds on the prime material plane, and has a mind flayer population of 3 billion, where they are in constant combat with the local elves and lizardfolk. I find that highly unlikely, a population of 3 billion would starve. From what I’ve found in the past, all evidence seems to show that mindflayer civilisations tend to only reach around 100, before splitting off to settle a new city. They couldn’t possibly have a civilisation that would be considered a giant metropolis. </p>

            <p>It goes on to detail the astromundian mindflayers, referring to them as ‘spelljammers’, stating that they have a more liberal, academic view of the universe, and rely less on domination from Elder Brains. Regular illithid would find this heretical, and I find it borderline impossible unless they are overcoming their nature. Based on the comments from the dead mindflayer, I believe that it may have originated from the astromundi itself. That would explain why it was alone in Sigil, at the very least.</p>

            <p>The second section of the book is entitled Xanxost’s Guide to Calamari, It’s a long-winded diatribe by a lunatic, describing how he cooks and eats Mind Flayers, a humorous read to be sure, and the dead mindflayers notes on it were just as fun to read, with the sheer amount of disgust it had for Xanxost. The book began with a lovely opening from Xanxost (him/her) self, “HELLO MORTALS I AM XANXOST :)”. The recipes that it contains are discussions on mindflayers and their physical weaknesses and their anatomy. Despite the style of writing, with the tangents, the focus on food and the seeming inability to count, it is incredibly accurate. One of the tangents that I read detailed Xanxost beating a Demonic Vrock to death and turning it into a hat, I believe that this Xanxost is a Slaad, an examplar of chaos from limbo. An interesting find to be sure, an academic Slaadi is almost antithetical to their race, they’re usually too chaotic to even bother with coherent thought, let alone writing them down. </p>
            
            <p>The third section of the book is a copy of The Sargonne Prophecies.  It’s a collection of rubbings and notes from the ‘Forbidden city of Sargonne’, whoever wrote the notes seems to have a... loose grasp on sanity, with the way they used almost tries to make the reader feel small and insignificant while describing regular things. 
                <br>
            Sargonne seems to have been an ancient city, which is now in ruin and laced in shadow, lost in some distant realm. The sketches contained within are of twisted spires and broken walls, all with glyphs and runes on them. Each seems to describe some element of what is unmistakably regarding mind flayers and their history. The way that things are phrased are so fanciful and dreamlike that they are often mistaken for a prophecy rather than academia. I have heard of these so-called ‘prophecies’ before, it’s good to finally have a copy of these to study in more detail.  They say, simply that the mind flayers once lived on a forbidden world, ‘bathed in Eternal Night’, which was destroyed in some terrible cataclysm, which they fled from in flying ships. If I’m not mistaken, this is referencing the Nautiloids piloted by the Gaihk. The reference to the world being bathed in Eternal Night, reminds me of the common plot that mind flayers have often claimed to plan, that of course being blotting out the sun. A ridiculously terrible idea, to be sure, perhaps this ‘Night City’ is simply a primordial concept which explains their behaviour?  
            </p>

            <p>From what the mind flayer states in his notes this ‘Night City’ seems to be called ‘Penumbra’, and it was a ring-shaped world, not a single settlement. It was not night in the sky, but a great black well, of which all light was devoured and nothing going through its terrible sucking horizon ever emerged. Sometimes it was said, a whisper could be heard on the stellar winds. In the centre, in the walls of ‘Substare’, was a single black rod, a staff entwined with worm-motifs, and was the single most important item – a staff of mythical power containing a secret; </p>
            
            <p class="center">The mind flayers have no past, for they are only the future. <br>
                One day, all will be theirs – this is not a prophecy, but a physical fact. <br>
                What once was, no longer shall be, what shall be, always was. <br>
                Unity of rings. </p>

            <p>This sounds like posturing, as mind flayers oft do. However, if this has any semblance of truth, then it’s... concerning to say the least, partially because I wonder where the mind flayer got this knowledge from.  <br>
            Considering how the text in this section was written, I believe the writer to be an alienist, some kind of warlock from the far-realms. And of course, alienists are not often known for being sane. </p>

            <p>The fourth section of the book, Expedition to the far-realms. This one was short, detailing a team of Githzerai Anarchs using their chaos-shaping in order to go beyond reality itself. Believing that they know that surely, they could protect themselves with ease, as they knew the nature of the planes themselves.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They didn't.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The lone anarch that returned was so insane that he was put out of his misery, so that his latent chaos-shaping could not annihilate half of the Githzerai city. He screamed of ‘worms in his head’. Naturally this was compared to Ceremorphosis.  </p>

            <p>There are a number of theories that mind flayers originate from the far-realms, and the idea of the anarch returning from there screaming about a condition not unlike ceremorphosis seems to reinforce that theory. The mind flayer notes scoffed at the idea, and mocked the ‘weak willed slaves’ for falling so easily. What a delicious bit of irony regarding how it went down. </p>

            <p>Regardless, it is unfortunate that the anarch expedition failed so spectacularly, there may be a potential to learn from the far-realms. If I were to guess it was their chaotic nature itself that caused them to fail. I theorise that a party exploring a far realm must have a balance of chaotic, and lawful belief, as to tip the scales too far amongst the party, may cause the far realms to tip their balance accordingly. I have no proof of this, however. I will not be testing this theory any time soon, I would prefer not to suffer the same fate as the anarchs. </p>

            <p>The final section in this book, Whispers in the Dark, is a short treatise on Cranium rats, particularly in Sigil. Supposedly, mind flayers made them to create a psychic network of spies. The writer wonders why The Lady has yet to deal with them, as surely, they will one day try to topple her reign. 
            It seems that the cranium rats despise mind flayers to the point of being genocidal, which is somewhat hilarious, seeing as they are rats. In particular, talking to people mind controlled by the rats reveals plots to invade the realm of the illithid God-brain for... some reason. They’re too skittish to actually do anything long-term other than plot in the dark. At this point the writer almost seems to have been... mind controlled by them, as he begins to compliment them, saying things like: Poor things. Lovely things. Give them a pet, Give them some food. Yes, yes... </p>
            
            <p>The poor sod.</p>

            <p>Anyhow, here comes the delicious irony. Reading the mind flayers notes on this section were full of mocking derision for the rats. It says ‘As a proper academic, it’ll go down in the dark and prove to its colleagues that these vermin are just that!’  </p>

            <p>What a way to go, having your throat slit by a rat, of all things. What a weak-willed fool it was. </p>

            <p>The book has certainly opened my eyes to a few ideas, not all of them being necessarily good. Regardless, I’m not here writing a book review. It's time to get on with documenting the main portion of my day.  </p>

            <p>After finishing studying the book, it was just around time to meet my employees and pay them for their work, I had picked up another contract before heading down there, just so that I could entice them into more work if they wanted it. I need to build up a bit of rapport with them if I’m going to have them help in my investigation. Right now, they have little reason to want to help me, and I need to make myself seem trustworthy. I decided to give them the option; Travel to another plane via the Infinite Staircase and resolve an issue there, or begin tracking down the murderer of Xerses, and by extension; the silver sword. </p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, they chose to travel to another plane and solve a bit of a mystery. I can’t say I’m too surprised, it’s likely what I would have chosen in their shoes. I may push a touch harder for the investigation afterwards, I may also consult one of the clerks about offering them a more specialised contract to entice them further, more pay can sway many minds. Well, that’s assuming that they remain efficient. </p>

            <p>So off we went to the market district, to the most accessible permanent portal to the IS. Right outside there was someone openly worshipping The Lady, the fool that he was. We entered the IS the usual way for this opening, walking backwards while humming, and then we headed to our destination and found a keeper of the staircase. She explained that a bunch of mind flayers had been chased into it by a group of Githzerai, and then it has been ‘destabilised’ in some way. After getting some details about the plane we were going into, we headed inside. It’s... interesting. The architecture is so very non-descript. There are no common identifiers, it’s almost like the very concept of a library, brought to reality</p>
            
            <p>The walls are only bookshelves and archways, and every single book on the shelves is blank. I’m not entirely sure on this next point but there almost seems to be some kind of wild magic field there. As if casting a spell causes latent energy to spark and cast something else.</p>

            <p>While exploring the library we found a room that looked like a group of artists gathering to paint a similar subject. Someone apparently noticed that one of the items (A plant on a table) was looking at us. It turned out that the plant, and a few chairs, were actually mimics! An interesting place to find them, that’s certain. </p>

            <p>After we dealt with them, we carried on through the library, and I found a book that actually had writing in it, which I decided to check-out. A history of the planes, dated about 10 years ago, it could be an interesting read for later. </p>

            <p>And off we found a tower and started to scale it. Inside we found a number of dead mind flayers, looted and beheaded. And that’s when it struck me, the Githzerai group that pursued them was a rrakkma group! A mind flayer hunting party that typically hunts mind flayers and Githyanki for spiritual reasons. I hope we don’t run into them, or at least, I hope they’re weakened from fighting if we do. </p>

            <p>At the top of the tower were a number of murals on the walls, with a number of different creatures detailed, along with a table in the centre with a ball embedded into it. It turned out to be some kind of riddle, that the bard of all people worked out! 
            I’m not entirely sure on the details, I usually take more time to study the puzzles I find than I had. </p>

            <p>After it was solved, a beam of light shot from the table, out of a stained-glass window and smashed it. It’s time to see what’s out there I suppose? </p>
