                Welcome! On this site you shall learn of the adventures of Vymis, one of the Guvners of Sigil!
                <br>
                A Githyanki specialist, Vymis is an archaeologist searching the planes for traces of his races' history, through their enslavers ruined cities. 
                Trained from childhood to be a warrior, Vymis had a number of prejudices instilled upon him, some of which he has overcome, but some are still deeply entrenched.
                <br>
                Vymis specialises in psionic attacks, fighting with blades made of his own will.
                <br><br>
                Vymis lives a simple life, often finding monetary gain irrelevant. However, when in need of a bit of gold, he'll use the scholarly guise to give him better odds in the local fight pits, acting weak and frail, before wiping the floor with the poor fool that steps into the pit.
                <br><br>
                His story is incomplete. Here you will be able to read his journal entries as it unfolds.
