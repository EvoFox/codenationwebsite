                <h2>Dead Githyanki, Xerses, with missing silver sword: </h2>
                <li>He was slain with the silver sword, seemingly with no struggle. My current theory is that he was either killed by a friend, or was stunned through some psychic power. </li>
                <li>The writing on the wall, in blood, was written in Abyssal. Later detail seems to imply that it is chaos-speak. </li>
                <li>He was a member of the Fraternity of Order - who did not know that he held a Githyanki military rank, let alone a captain's rank.  </li>
                <li>I have been told that I should keep an eye out for things, as I may be best suited for this kind of work. This may allow me to rise through the ranks of the Fraternity of Order. </li>

                <h2>Archaeology trip; Under Sigil</h2>
                <li>We found an illithid shrine, radiating contentment, with a prayer in Qualith enscribed upon it. Later detail revealed that the mind flayer had brought it while it was attempting to kill Cranium Rats.</li>
                <li>We found a dead mindflayer that had its' throat cut. Later detail revealed that the Cranium Rats were likely what did it.</li>
                <li>The dead mindflayer seems to have been a scholarly type, and had been in the process of translating and annotating some books into Qualith</li>
                <li>I have taken the book, and translated the mindflayer notes.</li>

                <h2>Contract work, The Library</h2>
                <li>Our mission was to find out what was causing the instability of one of the planes on the Infinite Staircase. It was discovered to be a piece of Godsman iconography.</li>
                <li>The Library is a "showroom example" of what a library is. No identifying features, and all of the books are empty.</li>
                <li>A Githzerai Rrakkma group seems to have been chasing some mindflayers, we later saw that they had turned on each other for some reason.</li>
                <li>We solved a puzzle, which caused a beam to shoot out of the tower we were in to a central tower with a large rock crystal, which we surmised was an overflowing mana battery for a ritual to create gods.</li>
                <li>We took the mana battery with us, planning to leave with it to attempt to solve the issue of The Library tearing itself apart</li>
                <li>Upon leaving the Library, we came across a group of Godsmen who really didn't want the paperwork that will still be coming their way. We handed the crystal off to them, due to the laws of Sigil regarding faction iconography.</li>

                <h2>Aurora and the White Stag</h2>
                <li>Aurora is on a quest from Lord Oberon to find *the* White Stag. She has no idea what a stag is.</li>
                <li>She saw the name of a co-signer on the contract, with the surname White-Stag and demanded to meet him. She signed the contract to meet him. I have yet to arrange this meeting.</li>
                <li>I am likely to communicate to him in bureaucratic double-speak to imply that the appointment may be a bad idea and to fill up his schedule until the problem goes away.</li>           
            </quest>

            <quest>
                <span class="pin"></span>
                <h2>Aurora and the Indeps</h2>
                <li>Aurora is renting a room at the Red Lion. The Indeps (totally not) clubhouse. She's likely to either be indoctrinated into their ranks, or protected from the other factions.</li>
                <li>I could either try a bit of indoctrination of my own, or dissuade her from being indoctrinated. Most likely the latter. She's not exactly Fraternity of Order material.</li>

                <h2>War-forged and the firearms</h2>
                <li>The War-forged has taken a liking to the firearms of Sun At Dust and wants to judge their worth</li>
